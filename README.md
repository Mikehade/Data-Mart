## 2.) Creation of the database using MySQL
###    Upon normalization in modelling of ER diagram into a working database, some more tables were included which increased the total amount of tables to 23
## 3.) Creation of tables in database created
## 4.) Altering of created tables in the database by adding foreign keys and constraints in order to maintain referential integrity on deletion
## 5.) Inserting of data into rows in various tables using transactions so as to utilize the flexibility of using rollback whenever there is an error in data when inserting
